# CSS Opacity

CSS opacity is a property that allows you to control the transparency of an element. It affects the visibility of an element and its contents, making it partially transparent or completely invisible.

## Setting Opacity

The `opacity` property accepts a value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents complete transparency (invisible) and 1 represents full opacity (fully visible).

To set the opacity of an element, use the following CSS syntax:

\\\css
selector {
  opacity: value;
}
\\\

For example, to make a `<div>` element 50% transparent, you would use:

\\\css
div {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
\\\

## Applying Opacity to Child Elements

When you apply opacity to a parent element, the opacity value is also inherited by its child elements. This means that the child elements will also have the same level of transparency as the parent.

If you want to make only the parent element transparent while keeping the child elements fully visible, you can use the `rgba()` color notation. By specifying an RGBA color value, you can control the opacity of the element independently of its child elements.

For example, to make a `<div>` element with a transparent background color but keep its child elements fully visible, you can use:

\\\css
div {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5); /* 50% transparent blue */
}
\\\

## Opacity vs. Transparency

It's important to note that setting the opacity of an element affects not only the element itself but also its content. This means that if you set an element to be transparent, its child elements will also be affected and become transparent.
