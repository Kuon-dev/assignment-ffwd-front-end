# Java Regular Expressions

Regular expressions provide a powerful way to search, match, and manipulate text. In Java, you can work with regular expressions using the `java.util.regex` package.

## Creating a Regular Expression

To create a regular expression in Java, you can use the `Pattern` class. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

String regex = "``d+"; // Matches one or more digits
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);
```

In the above example, we create a regular expression pattern that matches one or more digits using the `Pattern.compile()` method.

## Matching a Regular Expression

To match a regular expression against a string, you can use the `Matcher` class. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;

String text = "The answer is 42.";
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);
boolean isMatch = matcher.find(); // Checks if the pattern is found in the text
```

In the above example, we create a `Matcher` object and use the `find()` method to check if the pattern is found in the given text.

## Extracting Matched Text

You can extract the matched text from a regular expression using the `Matcher` class. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;

String text = "The answer is 42.";
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);
if (matcher.find()) {
    String matchedText = matcher.group(); // Retrieves the matched text
}
```

In the above example, we use the `group()` method to retrieve the matched text. If the pattern is found, the matched text will be stored in the `matchedText` variable.

## Replacing Text

Regular expressions can also be used to replace text in Java. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;

String text = "The answer is 42.";
String replacement = "unknown";
String result = text.replaceAll(regex, replacement); // Replaces all occurrences of the pattern
```

In the above example, we use the `replaceAll()` method to replace all occurrences of the pattern with the specified replacement text.

## Splitting Text

Regular expressions can be used to split a string into substrings based on a pattern. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

String text = "apple,banana,orange";
String[] fruits = text.split(",");
```

In the above example, we split the text into an array of substrings using the `split()` method. The pattern `","` is used to split the text wherever a comma is found.

Java's regular expression API provides many more features and options for working with regular expressions. Understanding the syntax and patterns used in regular expressions will allow you to perform complex text processing tasks with ease.

Remember to escape special characters with a backslash (```) when using them in regular expressions.
