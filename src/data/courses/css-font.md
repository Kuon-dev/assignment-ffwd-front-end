When it comes to styling text on a website, CSS font properties are essential. In this tutorial, we'll cover everything you need to know about CSS font properties, including font-family, font-size, font-weight, font-style, and font-variant.

## CSS Font Family

The `font-family` property is used to set the font of an element. This property can accept one or more font family names as a value. If the first font family is not available, the browser will try the next one, and so on. For example:

```css
p {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
