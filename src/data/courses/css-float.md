# CSS Float

The CSS `float` property is used to position elements horizontally within their parent container. It allows elements to be floated to the left or right, causing content to flow around them.

## How Float Works

When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal document flow and moved to the left or right side of its container. Other elements then flow around the floated element.

Here's an example of using `float` to position an image to the right:

```css
img {
  float: right;
  margin: 10px;
}
