# Introduction to Ionic Color

In Ionic, colors play a crucial role in defining the visual appearance of your app's components. Ionic provides a predefined set of colors that you can use to style various elements within your application.

## Using Ionic Colors

Ionic offers a wide range of predefined colors that you can use for text, backgrounds, borders, buttons, and other UI components. These colors are defined in CSS variables and can be easily applied to your elements.

To use an Ionic color, you can apply the corresponding CSS class or CSS variable to the desired element. Here's an example of applying a color class to a button:

```html
<ion-button class="ion-color-primary">Primary Button</ion-button>
```

In this example, we apply the `ion-color-primary` class to an `ion-button` element to make it use the primary color defined in Ionic's color palette.
