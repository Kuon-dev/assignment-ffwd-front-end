# JavaScript Statements

In JavaScript, a statement is a piece of code that performs a specific action. Statements are the building blocks of JavaScript programs, and they are executed one after another in a sequential order. In this tutorial, we'll explore some common JavaScript statements.

## 1. Variable Declaration and Assignment

One of the most basic statements in JavaScript is declaring and assigning values to variables. Variables are used to store data. Here's an example:

```javascript
let message = 'Hello, world!';
```

In this example, we declare a variable named `message` using the `let` keyword and assign the string `'Hello, world!'` to it. This statement creates a variable and assigns a value to it.

## 2. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow us to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions. The most commonly used conditional statement in JavaScript is the `if` statement. Here's an example:

```javascript
let age = 25;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log('You are an adult.');
} else {
  console.log('You are a minor.');
}
```

In this example, we check the value of the `age` variable. If the age is greater than or equal to 18, the code inside the `if` block will execute and print 'You are an adult.' to the console. Otherwise, the code inside the `else` block will execute and print 'You are a minor.'.

## 3. Looping Statements

Looping statements allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. The most common looping statements in JavaScript are `for` and `while` loops. Here's an example of a `for` loop:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

This loop will execute the code block inside it five times, printing the values 1 to 5 to the console.

These are just a few examples of JavaScript statements. JavaScript provides a wide range of statements for different purposes, such as function declarations, switch statements, and more. By combining and using these statements effectively, you can create powerful and dynamic JavaScript programs.

Remember to use proper syntax and pay attention to indentation while writing statements to ensure your code is clear and readable.

Keep practicing and experimenting with different statements to become proficient in JavaScript programming!
