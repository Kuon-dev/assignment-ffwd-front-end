# HTML Layout

HTML provides various elements and techniques to structure and organize the content of a web page. The layout of a web page determines the placement and arrangement of different sections and components. Understanding HTML layout is crucial for creating well-structured and visually appealing websites.

## Basic Layout Elements

### `<header>`

The `<header>` element represents the introductory content at the top of a web page or section. It typically contains the site logo, navigation menu, and other header-related elements.

### `<nav>`

The `<nav>` element represents a section of navigation links that guide users to different parts of a website. It is commonly used to create menus or navigation bars.

### `<main>`

The `<main>` element represents the main content of a web page. It should contain the primary content that is unique to each page. There should be only one `<main>` element per page.

### `<section>`

The `<section>` element represents a standalone section of content within a document. It is often used to divide the content into meaningful blocks or chapters.

### `<article>`

The `<article>` element represents a self-contained composition that can be independently distributed or reused. It is suitable for blog posts, news articles, or any other independent content.

### `<aside>`

The `<aside>` element represents content that is tangentially related to the main content but can be considered separate. It is often used for sidebars, pull quotes, or advertising sections.

### `<footer>`

The `<footer>` element represents the footer or bottom section of a web page or section. It typically contains information such as copyright notices, contact details, or additional navigation links.

## Layout Techniques

### Using `<div>`

The `<div>` element is a generic container that is commonly used to group and organize HTML elements. By applying CSS styling to `<div>` elements, you can create custom layouts and structure your web page as desired.

### CSS Grid

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex grid-based layouts. By defining rows and columns, you can easily position and align elements within a grid container.

### CSS Flexbox

CSS Flexbox is a flexible box layout model that simplifies the positioning and alignment of elements. It provides a one-dimensional layout system that is ideal for creating flexible and responsive designs.

Understanding how to use elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` allows you to create well-structured web pages.
