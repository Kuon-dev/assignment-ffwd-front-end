# PHP Loops

In PHP, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. They provide a powerful way to perform repetitive tasks without writing redundant code. PHP offers several loop structures, including `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and `foreach`.

## 1. for Loop

The `for` loop is commonly used when you know the exact number of iterations. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

`````````
php
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}
`````````

Here's an example that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a `for` loop:

`````````
php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    echo $i . " ";
}
`````````

Output: 1,2,3,4,5


## 2. while Loop

The `while` loop is used when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration.

`````````
php
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
`````````

Here's an example that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop:

`````````
php
$i = 1;
while ($i <= 5) {
    echo $i . " ";
    $i++;
}
`````````

Output: 1,2,3,4,5


## 3. do-while Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but the condition is checked after each iteration. This guarantees that the code inside the loop is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

`````````
php
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
`````````

Here's an example that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a `do-while` loop:

`````````
php
$i = 1;
do {
    echo $i . " ";
    $i++;
} while ($i <= 5);
`````````

Output:1, 2 3, 4, 5


## 4. foreach Loop

The `foreach` loop is used specifically for iterating over arrays or traversing the elements of an object. It automatically assigns the value of each element to a variable for processing.

`````````
php
foreach ($array as $value) {
    // Code to be executed
}
`````````

Here's an example that prints the elements of an array:

`````````
php
$fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
foreach ($fruits as $fruit) {
    echo $fruit . " ";
}
`````````

Output: apple, banana, orange
