# HTML Formatting

HTML provides various formatting options to enhance the visual appearance of your web pages. You can use formatting elements and tags to apply styles, emphasize text, create headings, add line breaks, and more.

## Text Formatting

### Bold Text

To make text bold, you can use the `\<strong>` or `\<b>` tag:

```
```<strong>This text is bold\</strong>
```<b>This text is also bold\</b>
```

### Italic Text

To italicize text, you can use the `\<em>` or `\<i>` tag:

```
```<em>This text is italic\</em>
```<i>This text is also italic\</i>
```

### Underlined Text

To underline text, you can use the `\<u>` tag:

```
```<u>This text is underlined\</u>
```

### Strikethrough Text

To strike through text, you can use the `\<s>` tag:

```
```<s>This text is strikethrough\</s>
```

## Headings

HTML provides six levels of headings, from `\<h1>` to `\<h6>`, with `\<h1>` being the highest level and `\<h6>` being the lowest level. Headings are used to structure and organize the content of a web page:

```
```<h1>This is a Heading 1\</h1>
```<h2>This is a Heading 2\</h2>
```<h3>This is a Heading 3\</h3>
```<h4>This is a Heading 4\</h4>
```<h5>This is a Heading 5\</h5>
```<h6>This is a Heading 6\</h6>
```

## Line Breaks

To create a line break, you can use the `\<br>` tag:

```
This is the first line.\<br>
This is the second line.
```

## Preformatted Text

To display preformatted text, you can use the `\<pre>` tag. This tag preserves white spaces, line breaks, and indentation:

```
```<pre>
This is
   preformatted
      text.
\\</pre>
```

## Conclusion

HTML offers a variety of formatting options to style and structure your content. By using text formatting tags, headings, line breaks, and preformatted text, you can enhance the readability and visual appeal of your web pages. Experiment with different formatting techniques to create professional and well-organized content. Happy coding!
