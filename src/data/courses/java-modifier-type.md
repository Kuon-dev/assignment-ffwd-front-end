# Java Modifier Types

In Java, modifier types are keywords that are used to modify classes, methods, and variables to define their accessibility, behavior, and restrictions. Java provides a set of modifier types that allow you to control the visibility and behavior of your code.

## Access Modifiers

Access modifiers determine the accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. Java has four access modifiers:

- `public`: The `public` modifier makes a class, method, or variable accessible to all other classes.
- `protected`: The `protected` modifier makes a class, method, or variable accessible within the same package or subclasses.
- `private`: The `private` modifier makes a class, method, or variable accessible only within the same class.
- Default (no modifier): If no access modifier is specified, the class, method, or variable is accessible within the same package.

The following example demonstrates the usage of access modifiers:

``java
public class MyClass {
    public int publicVar;
    protected int protectedVar;
    private int privateVar;
    int defaultVar;
}
``

## Non-Access Modifiers

Non-access modifiers are used to modify the behavior or characteristics of classes, methods, and variables. Java has several non-access modifiers:

- `final`: The `final` modifier indicates that a class cannot be inherited, a method cannot be overridden, or a variable cannot be reassigned.
- `abstract`: The `abstract` modifier indicates that a class cannot be instantiated or a method does not have an implementation and must be overridden in a subclass.
- `static`: The `static` modifier indicates that a variable or method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class.
- `synchronized`: The `synchronized` modifier is used for thread synchronization, ensuring that only one thread can access a block of code at a time.
- `volatile`: The `volatile` modifier is used for variables that are shared among multiple threads, ensuring their visibility and preventing certain optimizations.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of non-access modifiers:

```java
public abstract class AbstractClass {
    public static final int MAX_VALUE = 100;

    public abstract void abstractMethod();

    public static void staticMethod() {
        // Code here
    }

    public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
        // Code here
    }

    public volatile int volatileVar;
}
```

Understanding and properly using modifier types in Java allows you to control the visibility, behavior, and characteristics of your classes, methods, and variables. By using the appropriate modifiers, you can design more robust and secure code.
