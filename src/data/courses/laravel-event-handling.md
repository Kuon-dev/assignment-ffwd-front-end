# Laravel Event Handling

Event handling is an important aspect of building robust and decoupled applications. Laravel provides a powerful event system that allows you to handle and dispatch events throughout your application. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to work with events in Laravel and leverage them to build flexible and maintainable code.

## Introduction to Events

In Laravel, events serve as a way to notify other parts of your application when a specific action or state change occurs. Events can be used to trigger actions, update data, or perform any other operation that needs to be executed in response to an event.

The Laravel event system follows a publisher-subscriber model. When an event is triggered, one or more event listeners or subscribers respond to that event by executing their defined logic.

## Creating Events

To create an event in Laravel, you can use the `make:event` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan make:event OrderCreated
```

This command generates an `OrderCreated` event class in the `app/Events` directory. Inside the event class, you can define any properties or data that you want to pass along with the event.

## Creating Listeners

Listeners are responsible for handling events. To create a listener in Laravel, you can use the `make:listener` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan make:listener SendOrderConfirmation --event=OrderCreated
```

This command generates a `SendOrderConfirmation` listener class in the `app/Listeners` directory. Inside the listener class, you can define the logic that should be executed when the associated event is triggered.

## Registering Event Listeners

To make your listeners respond to events, you need to register them in Laravel's event service provider. The service provider is located at `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`. Inside the `listen` array, you can map events to their corresponding listeners.

For example, if you have an `OrderCreated` event and a `SendOrderConfirmation` listener, you can register them as follows:

```php
protected $listen = [
    OrderCreated::class => [
        SendOrderConfirmation::class,
    ],
];
