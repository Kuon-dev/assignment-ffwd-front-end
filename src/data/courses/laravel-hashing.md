# Laravel Hashing

Hashing is an essential technique for securely storing passwords and sensitive data in your Laravel applications. Laravel provides a convenient way to hash and verify data using robust hashing algorithms. In this tutorial, we'll explore Laravel's hashing features and learn how to hash and verify data effectively.

## Introduction to Laravel Hashing

Laravel utilizes the `bcrypt` algorithm, which is a strong and secure hashing algorithm, to hash and verify data. When you hash data, it undergoes a one-way transformation, making it extremely difficult to reverse-engineer the original value.

## Hashing Data

To hash data in Laravel, you can use the `bcrypt` helper function provided by Laravel. This function accepts a string and returns the hashed version of the data.

Here's an example of hashing a password:

```php
$password = 'mysecretpassword';
$hashedPassword = bcrypt($password);
```

The `bcrypt` function automatically generates a secure salt for each hashed value, making each hash unique even for identical passwords.

## Verifying Hashed Data

To verify if a given value matches a hashed value, you can use the `Hash` facade's `check` method. This method accepts the plain value and the hashed value and returns `true` if they match, or `false` otherwise.

Here's an example of verifying a password:

```php
$password = 'mysecretpassword';
$hashedPassword = bcrypt($password);

$isValid = Hash::check($password, $hashedPassword);
```

The `check` method will compare the plain value with the hashed value and return the result of the comparison.

## Hashing Options

Laravel's `bcrypt` function supports an optional second argument, which allows you to specify additional options for the hashing process. One common option is the "rounds" parameter, which determines the computational cost of hashing. By default, Laravel uses a value of 10 for rounds, but you can adjust it according to your needs.

Here's an example of hashing a password with a custom number of rounds:

```php
$password = 'mysecretpassword';
$hashedPassword = bcrypt($password, ['rounds' => 12]);
```

Increasing the number of rounds increases the time and computational resources required to hash the value, making it more secure against brute-force attacks.

## Conclusion

Laravel's hashing features provide a reliable and secure way to hash and verify data in your applications. By properly hashing sensitive information such as passwords, you can protect user data and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your application.
