# C++ Operators

Operators in C++ are symbols or keywords that perform various operations on operands. They allow you to manipulate data, perform mathematical calculations, compare values, and more. C++ provides a wide range of operators categorized into different types. Let's explore some of the commonly used operator types:

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical calculations. Here are the arithmetic operators available in C++:
```
| Operator | Description          | Example                 |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| +        | Addition             | `int result = a + b;`   |
| -        | Subtraction          | `int result = a - b;`   |
| *        | Multiplication       | `int result = a * b;`   |
| /        | Division             | `int result = a / b;`   |
| %        | Modulus (Remainder)  | `int result = a % b;`   |
| ++       | Increment            | `a++;`                  |
| --       | Decrement            | `a--;`                  |
```
## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They also perform an operation along with assignment. Here are some commonly used assignment operators:
```
| Operator | Description          | Example              |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| =        | Assignment           | `int x = 10;`        |
| +=       | Addition assignment  | `x += 5;`            |
| -=       | Subtraction assignment | `x -= 5;`          |
| *=       | Multiplication assignment | `x *= 2;`        |
| /=       | Division assignment  | `x /= 2;`            |
| %=       | Modulus assignment   | `x %= 3;`            |
```
## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean result (true or false) based on the comparison. Here are the comparison operators available in C++:
```
| Operator | Description          | Example                 |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| ==       | Equal to             | `if (a == b)`           |
| !=       | Not equal to         | `if (a != b)`           |
| <        | Less than            | `if (a < b)`            |
| >        | Greater than         | `if (a > b)`            |
| <=       | Less than or equal to | `if (a <= b)`           |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | `if (a >= b)`         |
```
## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. They combine conditions and return a boolean result. Here are the logical operators available in C++:

```
| Operator | Description          | Example                  |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| &&       | Logical AND          | `if (a && b)`            |
| \|\|     | Logical OR           | `if (a \|\| b)`          |
| !        | Logical NOT          | `if (!a)`                |
```
