# CSS Box Model

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web development that describes how elements are rendered and displayed on a webpage. It consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is crucial for controlling the layout and spacing of elements on a webpage.

## Box Model Components

1. Content: It represents the actual content of an element, such as text, images, or other media. The content area is determined by the width and height properties.

2. Padding: Padding is the space between the content and the element's border. It provides visual separation between the content and the border. Padding can be set using the `padding` property and can have different values for each side of the element (e.g., `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left`).

3. Border: The border is a line or outline that surrounds the padding and content of an element. It separates the element from its neighboring elements. Borders can be styled using properties like `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color`.

4. Margin: The margin is the space outside the border and provides the gap between adjacent elements. It controls the distance between elements on a page. Margins can be set using the `margin` property and can have different values for each side of the element (e.g., `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`).
