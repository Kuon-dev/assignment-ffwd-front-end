# CSS Box Model

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements on a web page are rendered and interact with one another. Understanding the box model is crucial for controlling the layout and spacing of elements. Let's explore the different components of the box model.

## Content

The content area is the innermost part of an element and holds the actual content, such as text, images, or other elements. The size of the content area is determined by the `width` and `height` properties.

## Padding

Padding is the space between the content area and the element's border. It provides internal spacing within the element. The padding can be adjusted using the `padding` property, and you can set different padding values for each side of the element or use the shorthand notation.

```css
.element {
  padding: 10px;
}
