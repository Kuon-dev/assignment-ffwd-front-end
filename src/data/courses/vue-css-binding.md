# Vue CSS Binding

In Vue.js, you can dynamically apply CSS classes and inline styles to elements using the CSS binding feature. This allows you to manipulate the appearance of your application based on data and component state. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use CSS binding in Vue.

## Class Binding

To apply CSS classes conditionally in Vue, you can use the `v-bind:class` directive or its shorthand `:class`. This directive allows you to bind a class or an object containing multiple classes to an element based on certain conditions. Here's an example:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <button :class="{ active: isActive, disabled: isDisabled }">Click me</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      isActive: true,
      isDisabled: false
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

In this example, the `:class="{ active: isActive, disabled: isDisabled }"` directive applies the classes `active` and `disabled` to the button element conditionally. The `isActive` and `isDisabled` properties control the presence of these classes. When `isActive` is `true`, the `active` class will be applied, and when `isDisabled` is `true`, the `disabled` class will be applied.

You can also bind CSS classes dynamically using computed properties or methods. Here's an example using a computed property:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <button :class="buttonClasses">Click me</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    buttonClasses() {
      return {
        active: this.isActive,
        disabled: this.isDisabled
      };
    }
  },
  data() {
    return {
      isActive: true,
      isDisabled: false
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

In this example, the `buttonClasses` computed property returns an object that determines the presence of classes based on component data. By using computed properties, you can apply more complex class binding logic and keep your template clean.

## Style Binding

In addition to class binding, Vue also provides the `v-bind:style` directive or `:style` shorthand to apply inline styles to elements dynamically. This directive accepts an object or a computed property that defines the styles to be applied. Here's an example:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <div :style="{ color: textColor, fontSize: fontSize + 'px' }">Hello, Vue!</div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      textColor: 'blue',
      fontSize: 16
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

In this example, the `:style="{ color: textColor, fontSize: fontSize + 'px' }"` directive applies inline styles to the `<div>` element. The `textColor` and `fontSize` properties control the respective styles. The `textColor` property determines the color, and the `fontSize` property determines the font size in pixels.
