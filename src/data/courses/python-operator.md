# Python Operators

Operators in Python are symbols or special keywords that perform various operations on operands (variables or values). Python provides a wide range of operators for different purposes. Here are some commonly used operators in Python:

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations:

- Addition (`+`): Adds two operands together.
- Subtraction (`-`): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- Multiplication (`*`): Multiplies two operands.
- Division (`/`): Divides the first operand by the second.
- Modulus (`%`): Returns the remainder of the division.
- Exponentiation (`**`): Raises the first operand to the power of the second.
- Floor Division (`//`): Returns the quotient of the division, discarding any remainder.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

- `=`: Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
- `+=`: Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the result.
- `-=`: Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the result.
- `*=`: Multiplies the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result.
- `/=`: Divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result.
- `%=`: Performs modulus operation on the variable and assigns the result.
- `**=`: Raises the variable on the left to the power of the value on the right and assigns the result.
- `//=`: Performs floor division on the variable and assigns the result.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare the values of operands and return a boolean result (`True` or `False`):

- Equal to (`==`): Returns `True` if the values are equal.
- Not equal to (`!=`): Returns `True` if the values are not equal.
- Greater than (`>`): Returns `True` if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- Less than (`<`): Returns `True` if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`): Returns `True` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
- Less than or equal to (`<=`): Returns `True` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and return a boolean result:

- `and`: Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.
- `or`: Returns `True` if either of the operands is `True`.
- `not`: Returns the opposite boolean value of the operand.

## Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to test if a value is present in a sequence:

- `in`: Returns `True` if a value is found in the specified sequence.
- `not in`: Returns `True` if a value is not found in the specified sequence.

## Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the memory location of two objects:

- `is`: Returns `True` if both operands refer to the same object.
- `is not`: Returns `True` if both operands refer to different objects.

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of integers:

- `&`: Bitwise AND.
- `|`: Bitwise OR.
- `^`: Bitwise XOR.
- `~`: Bitwise NOT.
- `<<`: Bitwise left shift.
- `>>`: Bitwise right shift.
