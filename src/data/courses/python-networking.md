# Python Networking

Python provides powerful libraries and modules for networking tasks, allowing you to create client-server applications, communicate over various protocols, and perform network-related operations. In this tutorial, we'll explore the basics of networking using Python.

## Socket Programming

Socket programming is a fundamental concept in networking. Sockets enable communication between two nodes over a network. Python's `socket` module provides an interface for socket programming. Here's an example of creating a simple TCP server using sockets:

```python
import socket

# Create a socket object
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the socket to a specific address and port
server_address = ("localhost", 12345)
server_socket.bind(server_address)

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(1)

# Accept a connection
client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()

# Receive data from the client
data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print("Received:", data.decode())

# Send a response to the client
response = "Hello, client!"
client_socket.send(response.encode())

# Close the connection
client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()

In this example, we create a TCP server socket using the `socket.socket()` method. We bind the socket to a specific address and port using the `bind()` method. Then, we listen for incoming connections using the `listen()` method. When a client connects, we accept the connection using the `accept()` method. We can then receive data from the client using the `recv()` method and send a response using the `send()` method.

## Sending and Receiving Data

Python's socket module provides methods for sending and receiving data over a network. Here's an example of a TCP client that connects to a server and sends/receives data:

```python
import socket

# Create a socket object
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the server
server_address = ("localhost", 12345)
client_socket.connect(server_address)

# Send data to the server
data = "Hello, server!"
client_socket.send(data.encode())

# Receive a response from the server
response = client_socket.recv(1024)
print("Response:", response.decode())

# Close the connection
client_socket.close()

In this example, we create a TCP client socket and connect it to the server using the `connect()` method. We can then send data to the server using the `send()` method and receive a response using the `recv()` method.

## Working with Protocols

Python supports various networking protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and more. There are dedicated libraries and modules available for working with these protocols. For example, the `http.client` module provides functionality for making HTTP requests. Here's an example:

```python
import http.client

# Create an HTTP connection
connection = http.client.HTTPSConnection("www.example.com")

# Send an HTTP request
connection.request("GET", "/")

# Get the response
response = connection.getresponse()

# Print the response status code and body
print("Status:", response.status)
print("Body:", response.read().decode())

# Close the connection
connection.close()

In this example, we create an HTTPS connection to `www.example.com` using the `http.client.HTTPSConnection()` method. We then send an HTTP request using the `request()` method and get the response using the `getresponse()` method. Finally, we can access the response status code and body.

## Conclusion

Python's networking capabilities allow you to build robust and scalable applications that communicate over networks using various protocols. Whether it's creating servers, implementing clients, or working
