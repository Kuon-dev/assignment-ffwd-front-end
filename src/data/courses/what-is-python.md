# What is Python?

Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other languages.

## Features of Python

Python offers several features that make it a versatile and powerful programming language:

1. **Easy to Learn**: Python has a straightforward syntax that is easy to understand, making it an ideal choice for beginners.

2. **Expressive and Readable**: Python code is designed to be readable and expressive, enabling developers to write clean and maintainable code.

3. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Python is available on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it highly versatile.

4. **Large Standard Library**: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides ready-to-use modules and functions for a wide range of tasks.

5. **Third-Party Packages**: Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks that extend its functionality for various domains such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.

6. **Interpreted Language**: Python is an interpreted language, which means that code execution occurs line by line, allowing for interactive development and rapid prototyping.

## Example Python Code

Here's a simple example of a "Hello, World!" program in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

The above code will output the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Use Cases for Python

Python is widely used across different domains and industries due to its versatility. Here are a few popular use cases:
