# Ruby on Rails Example

In this tutorial, we'll walk through a simple example of building a Ruby on Rails application. We'll create a basic blog application that allows users to create, view, and edit blog posts.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Ruby: [Installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- Rails: [Installation guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#installing-rails)

## Step 1: Create a New Rails Application

To create a new Rails application, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
rails new blog

This will generate a new Rails application in a directory called `blog`.

## Step 2: Generate the Blog Scaffold

Rails provides a convenient generator called `scaffold` that can generate the necessary files for a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. Run the following command to generate the scaffold for our blog:

```bash
rails generate scaffold Post title:string content:text

This command will generate the necessary files for a `Post` model with `title` and `content` attributes.

## Step 3: Run Migrations

Next, we need to run the database migrations to create the necessary tables in the database. Run the following command:

```bash
rails db:migrate

This will create a `posts` table in the database based on the migration file generated by the scaffold command.

## Step 4: Start the Rails Server

To start the Rails server and see our application in action, run the following command:

```bash
rails server
```
This will start the server, and you can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Step 5: Interact with the Application

With the Rails server running, you can now interact with the application. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/posts`. Here, you can create new posts, view existing posts, edit posts, and delete posts.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've built a basic blog application using Ruby on Rails. This example demonstrates the power and simplicity of Rails in creating web applications. Feel free to explore more features of Rails and customize the application to meet your specific needs.
