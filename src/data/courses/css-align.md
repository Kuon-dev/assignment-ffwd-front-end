# CSS Align

The CSS `align` property is used to control the alignment of elements within their parent container. It allows you to specify how elements should be aligned horizontally or vertically.

## Horizontal Alignment

To horizontally align elements within a container, you can use the `text-align` property. Here are some examples:

- Align text to the left:

  ```css
  .container {
    text-align: left;
  }
