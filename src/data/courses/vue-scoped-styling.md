# Vue Scoped Styling

Scoped styling in Vue.js allows you to encapsulate styles within a specific component, ensuring that the styles only apply to the elements within that component's template. This feature promotes component-level style isolation and avoids style conflicts in larger applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use scoped styling in Vue.

## Scoped Styles

To apply scoped styles to a Vue component, you can use the `scoped` attribute in the component's `<style>` tag. Here's an example:

```css
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Scoped Styling Example</h1>
    <p class="scoped">This paragraph has scoped styling applied.</p>
    <p>This paragraph does not have scoped styling.</p>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.scoped {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
</style>
```

In this example, the `<style>` tag includes the `scoped` attribute. This attribute indicates that the styles defined within the `<style>` block are scoped to the current component only. The `.scoped` class is used to target the specific element with scoped styling.

## Styling Limitations

Scoped styling in Vue has a limitation. It only applies to the elements within the component's template itself, not to its child components. If you want to style child components, you can use other methods like module-based CSS or CSS frameworks.

## Combining Scoped and Global Styles

Vue allows you to combine scoped styles with global styles by using both scoped and non-scoped style blocks within the same component. Here's an example:

```css
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Scoped and Global Styles Example</h1>
    <p class="scoped">This paragraph has scoped styling applied.</p>
    <p class="global">This paragraph has global styling applied.</p>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.scoped {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
</style>

<style>
.global {
  color: red;
  font-size: 20px;
}
</style>
```

In this example, we have a component with both scoped and global styles. The `.scoped` class has scoped styling applied, while the `.global` class has global styling applied. Both styles will be effective within the component.

## Styling Specificity

Scoped styling in Vue relies on CSS scoping techniques like attribute selectors to apply styles specifically to the component's elements. This helps to avoid style collisions between different components. It's important to be aware of the CSS specificity rules to understand how scoped styles are applied.

## Conclusion

Scoped styling in Vue provides a convenient way to encapsulate and isolate component-level styles. By using the `scoped` attribute in the `<style>` tag, you can ensure that the styles defined within a component only affect the elements within that component's template. This promotes reusability and avoids style conflicts, making your Vue components more maintainable and modular.
