# Ionic JS Side Menu

Ionic JS provides a Side Menu component that allows you to create a navigation menu that slides in from the side of the screen. The Side Menu component is commonly used in mobile applications to implement navigation and menu functionality. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the Ionic JS Side Menu component to create a side menu in your application.

## Creating a Side Menu

To create a side menu in Ionic JS, you need to use the `<ion-side-menu>` and `<ion-side-menu-content>` elements. The `<ion-side-menu>` element represents the menu itself, while the `<ion-side-menu-content>` element represents the main content of your application. Here's an example of how to create a basic side menu layout:

```html
<ion-side-menu side="left">
  <!-- Your menu content goes here -->
</ion-side-menu>

<ion-side-menu-content>
  <!-- Your main content goes here -->
</ion-side-menu-content>
```

In the example above, we have defined a side menu on the left side using the `side="left"` attribute. You can also specify `side="right"` if you want the menu to appear from the right side. Inside the `<ion-side-menu>` element, you can add any content you want for your menu, such as a list of navigation links or other components.

The main content of your application goes inside the `<ion-side-menu-content>` element. This is where you would typically place the content that corresponds to the selected menu item.

## Toggling the Side Menu

To toggle the side menu and show/hide it when the user interacts with your application, you can use the `$ionicSideMenuDelegate` service. Here's an example of how to add a button to toggle the side menu:

```html
<ion-header-bar>
  <button class="button button-icon" ng-click="toggleSideMenu()">
    <i class="icon ion-navicon"></i>
  </button>
</ion-header-bar>

<ion-side-menu side="left">
  <!-- Your menu content goes here -->
</ion-side-menu>

<ion-side-menu-content>
  <!-- Your main content goes here -->
</ion-side-menu-content>
```

In the example above, we have added a button to the header bar using the `<ion-header-bar>` element. The button has an `ng-click` attribute that calls the `toggleSideMenu()` function when clicked. Inside the function, we can use the `$ionicSideMenuDelegate.toggleLeft()` method to toggle the side menu. Similarly, you can use `$ionicSideMenuDelegate.toggleRight()` if you have a right-side menu.

## Customizing the Side Menu

Ionic JS provides various options to customize the appearance and behavior of the side menu. You can customize the width, enable swipe gestures to open/close the menu, add icons to the menu items, and more. Refer to the Ionic documentation for detailed information on the available customization options.

This is the basic usage of the Ionic JS Side Menu component. You can build upon this foundation to create complex side menu layouts and navigation structures for your Ionic applications.
