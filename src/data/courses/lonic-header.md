# Introduction to Ionic Header

The Ionic framework provides a powerful component called `ion-header` that allows you to create a header section for your app. The header typically contains the app title, navigation buttons, and other important elements.

## Usage of Ionic Header

To use the `ion-header` component, you need to include it in the template of your Ionic page or component. It serves as a container for the header content and is usually placed at the top of the page.

Here's an example of how you can use the `ion-header` component in an Ionic page:

```html
<ion-header>
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>
      My App
    </ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-header>
```

In the above example, the `ion-header` component contains an `ion-toolbar` component, which in turn includes an `ion-title` component to display the app title.

## Adding Navigation Buttons

You can enhance the functionality of the header by adding navigation buttons such as a back button or a menu toggle button. Ionic provides several pre-defined button components that you can use within the header.

For instance, to add a back button, you can use the `ion-back-button` component like this:

```html
<ion-header>
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-buttons slot="start">
      <ion-back-button></ion-back-button>
    </ion-buttons>
    <ion-title>
      My Page
    </ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-header>
```

The `ion-buttons` component with the `slot="start"` attribute is used to position the back button on the left side of the header.

## Styling the Header

You can customize the appearance of the header by applying CSS classes or inline styles. Ionic provides a set of CSS variables that you can use to modify various aspects of the header's styling.

For example, to change the background color of the header, you can apply the following CSS:

```css
ion-header {
  --ion-background-color: #333;
  --ion-color: #fff;
}
```

This will set the background color to dark gray (#333) and the text color to white (#fff). Feel free to experiment with other CSS properties and Ionic's color palette to achieve the desired visual effect.

## Conclusion

The `ion-header` component is a crucial part of Ionic that allows you to create a header section for your app. It provides a flexible and customizable way to display the app title, navigation buttons, and other important elements. Experiment with its usage, navigation buttons, and styling options to create an engaging and user-friendly app header.
