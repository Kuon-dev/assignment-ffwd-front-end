# Python GUI Programming

Graphical User Interface (GUI) programming allows users to interact with programs through visual elements such as windows, buttons, and menus. Python provides several libraries and frameworks that make it easy to create GUI applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore the basics of GUI programming using Python.

## Tkinter

Tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit for Python. It provides a set of widgets and functions for creating graphical applications. Here's an example of a simple Tkinter application:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main window
window = tk.Tk()

# Set the window title
window.title("My First GUI App")

# Create a label widget
label = tk.Label(window, text="Hello, Tkinter!")

# Pack the label widget into the window
label.pack()

# Start the Tkinter event loop
window.mainloop()

In this example, we import the `tkinter` module and create the main window using the `Tk()` constructor. We set the window title using the `title()` method. We create a `Label` widget with the text "Hello, Tkinter!" and pack it into the window using the `pack()` method. Finally, we start the Tkinter event loop using the `mainloop()` method.

## Widgets and Layout

Tkinter provides a variety of widgets that can be used to build GUI applications. Some common widgets include buttons, labels, entry fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. You can use layout managers such as `pack()`, `grid()`, or `place()` to arrange the widgets within a window.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of different widgets and layout:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main window
window = tk.Tk()

# Set the window title
window.title("Widgets and Layout")

# Create widgets
label = tk.Label(window, text="Label")
button = tk.Button(window, text="Button")
entry = tk.Entry(window)
checkbutton = tk.Checkbutton(window, text="Check Button")
radiobutton1 = tk.Radiobutton(window, text="Option 1")
radiobutton2 = tk.Radiobutton(window, text="Option 2")

# Add widgets to the window using grid layout
label.grid(row=0, column=0)
button.grid(row=0, column=1)
entry.grid(row=1, column=0, columnspan=2)
checkbutton.grid(row=2, column=0, columnspan=2)
radiobutton1.grid(row=3, column=0, sticky="w")
radiobutton2.grid(row=4, column=0, sticky="w")

# Start the Tkinter event loop
window.mainloop()

In this example, we create various widgets such as labels, buttons, entry fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. We use the `grid()` method to specify the layout of these widgets within a grid. The `row` and `column` parameters indicate the position of each widget, and the `columnspan` parameter allows a widget to span multiple columns.

## Event Handling

GUI applications often respond to user actions such as button clicks or menu selections. Tkinter provides a mechanism for handling events using event-driven programming. Here's an example that demonstrates event handling:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Event handler function
def button_clicked():
    label.config(text="Button Clicked!")

# Create the main window
window = tk.Tk()

# Set the window title
window.title("Event Handling")

# Create a label and button widget
label = tk.Label(window, text="Hello, Tkinter!")
button = tk.Button(window, text="Click Me", command=button_clicked
