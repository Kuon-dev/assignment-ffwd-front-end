# HTML Page Title

The page title is an important element in HTML that defines the title of a web page. It appears in the browser's title bar or tab and is also used by search engines to display the page title in search results.

## Setting the Page Title

To set the page title, you need to use the `<title>` element within the `<head>` section of your HTML document. Here's an example:

```
<head>
<title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
```

In the example above, the page title is set to "My Web Page" within the `<title>` tags. Replace "My Web Page" with your desired title.

## Best Practices for Page Titles

When creating page titles, it's important to follow some best practices:

1. Be descriptive: Use a concise and descriptive title that accurately represents the content of the web page.
2. Include keywords: Incorporate relevant keywords in the page title to improve search engine optimization (SEO).
3. Keep it concise: Aim for a title that is not too long, as overly lengthy titles may get truncated in search results.
4. Unique titles: Each page on your website should have a unique title to provide clear identification and avoid confusion.

Here's an example of a well-optimized page title:

```
<head>
<title>HTML Page Title Best Practices - Learn HTML | My Website</title>
</head>
```

In the example above, the page title includes relevant keywords, describes the content, and mentions the website name.

## Changing the Title Dynamically

In some cases, you may want to change the page title dynamically based on certain conditions or user interactions. You can achieve this using JavaScript by accessing the `<title>` element and modifying its content.

Here's an example of changing the page title using JavaScript:

```
<script>
    document.title = "New Page Title";
</script>
```

In the example above, the JavaScript code sets the page title to "New Page Title". You can replace this with any dynamic value based on your requirements.

## Conclusion

The page title is an essential HTML element that defines the title of a web page. By setting descriptive and keyword-rich titles, you can improve the visibility and relevance of your web pages in search results. Additionally, JavaScript allows you to change the page title dynamically if needed.
