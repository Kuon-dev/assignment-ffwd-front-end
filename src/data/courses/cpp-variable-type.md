# C++ Variable Types

In C++, variables are used to store data of different types. The type of a variable determines the kind of data it can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. C++ provides several built-in variable types, each with its own characteristics. In this tutorial, we'll cover some common variable types in C++.

## Integer Types

Integers are used to store whole numbers without fractional parts. In C++, there are different integer types available with varying sizes and ranges:

``cpp
int myInt = 10;           // Regular integer
short myShort = 5;        // Short integer
long myLong = 1000000;    // Long integer
long long myLongLong = 1234567890123456;   // Long long integer

## Floating-Point Types

Floating-point types are used to store real numbers with fractional parts. C++ provides two main floating-point types:

``cpp
float myFloat = 3.14;          // Single-precision floating point
double myDouble = 3.141592;    // Double-precision floating point

## Character Types

Character types are used to store individual characters. C++ provides two character types:

``cpp
char myChar = 'A';              // Single character
wchar_t myWideChar = L'ÂÆù';     // Wide character

## Boolean Type

Boolean type is used to represent true or false values. In C++, the keyword `bool` is used to declare boolean variables:

``cpp
bool myBool = true;             // Boolean variable
