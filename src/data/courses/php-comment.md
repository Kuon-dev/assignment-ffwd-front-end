# PHP Comment

In PHP, comments are used to add explanatory or descriptive notes within the code. Comments are ignored by the PHP interpreter and are not executed as part of the program.

There are two types of comments in PHP:

1. Single-line comments: These comments are used to add notes on a single line. Anything after the comment symbol `//` or `#` on the same line is considered a comment.

   `````````php
   // This is a single-line comment in PHP
   # This is also a single-line comment in PHP
   `````````

2. Multi-line comments: These comments span multiple lines and are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`. Multi-line comments are useful for adding longer explanations or disabling blocks of code.

   `````````php
   /*
   This is a
   multi-line comment
   in PHP
   */
   `````````

Comments play an important role in code documentation and can help make the code more readable and understandable for other developers.

It's good practice to use comments to provide information
