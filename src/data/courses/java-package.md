# Java Packages

Packages in Java provide a way to organize and structure classes and interfaces into hierarchical groups. A package is a collection of related classes and interfaces that serve a common purpose or belong to the same module. It helps in organizing code, avoiding naming conflicts, and providing access control. In this tutorial, we'll explore the concept of packages and how they can be used in Java.

## What is a Package?

A package in Java is a mechanism to group related classes and interfaces together. It acts as a namespace, preventing naming conflicts between classes with the same name in different packages. Packages provide a hierarchical structure, allowing you to organize your codebase into logical units.

Packages are declared using the `package` keyword at the beginning of a Java file. The package statement specifies the package name and must be the first line of code in the file (except for comments). By convention, package names are written in lowercase and follow a reverse domain name format to ensure uniqueness.

## Why Use Packages?

The main benefits of using packages in Java are:

- **Organizing Code**: Packages provide a way to organize classes and interfaces into meaningful groups, making it easier to navigate and maintain the codebase. It allows you to group related classes together, promoting code modularity and reusability.
- **Avoiding Naming Conflicts**: Packages help in avoiding naming conflicts between classes with the same name. By placing classes in different packages, you can have classes with the same name without conflicts, as long as they are in different packages.
- **Access Control**: Packages provide access control mechanisms through the use of access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, and default access). Classes and interfaces within a package can be declared with different access modifiers to control their visibility and accessibility from other packages.
- **Code Sharing and Reusability**: Packages enable code sharing and reusability by allowing classes and interfaces to be accessed and used by other classes and interfaces within the same or different packages. This promotes modular design and reduces code duplication.

## Creating and Using Packages

To create a package in Java, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Declare the Package**: At the beginning of each Java source file, use the `package` keyword followed by the package name. For example, `package com.example.mypackage;`.
2. **Place Classes in the Package**: Save the Java files with the package declaration in a directory structure that matches the package hierarchy. For example, if the package is `com.example.mypackage`, the file should be saved in a directory structure like `com/example/mypackage`.
