# Java Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. In Java, inheritance is achieved using the `extends` keyword. In this tutorial, we'll explore the basics of inheritance in Java.

## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a mechanism that enables a class to acquire properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) from another class. The class that inherits from another class is called the **subclass** or **derived class**, and the class being inherited from is called the **superclass** or **base class**.

## Creating a Subclass

To create a subclass in Java, you use the `extends` keyword in the class declaration. Here's an example:

```java
public class Subclass extends Superclass {
    // Subclass members
}
```

In the above example, the `Subclass` extends the `Superclass`. This means that the `Subclass` inherits all the fields and methods defined in the `Superclass`.

## Accessing Superclass Members

In a subclass, you can access the members (fields and methods) of the superclass using the `super` keyword. This is useful when you want to call the superclass's version of a method or access a field that is hidden by the subclass. Here's an example:

```java
public class Subclass extends Superclass {
    public void subclassMethod() {
        // Accessing superclass method
        super.superclassMethod();

        // Accessing superclass field
        int value = super.superclassField;
    }
}
```

In the above example, `super.superclassMethod()` calls the `superclassMethod()` defined in the superclass, and `super.superclassField` accesses the `superclassField` defined in the superclass.

## Overriding Methods

One of the key features of inheritance is method overriding. It allows the subclass to provide its own implementation of a method inherited from the superclass. To override a method, the subclass must define a method with the same name, return type, and parameter list as the superclass's method. Here's an example:

```java
public class Subclass extends Superclass {
    @Override
    public void superclassMethod() {
        // Subclass's implementation
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Subclass` overrides the `superclassMethod()` from the `Superclass` by providing its own implementation.

## Constructor Chaining

When a subclass is instantiated, the constructors of both the subclass and superclass are called. This is known as constructor chaining. The subclass's constructor can use the `super` keyword to explicitly call the superclass's constructor. Here's an example:

```java
public class Subclass extends Superclass {
    public Subclass() {
        super(); // Calls the superclass constructor
        // Subclass's constructor code
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Subclass` constructor calls the `super()` to invoke the superclass's constructor before executing its own code.

## Final and Abstract Classes

In Java, you can also define classes as `final` or `abstract`. A `final` class cannot be subclassed, meaning it cannot have any subclasses. An `abstract` class, on the other hand, is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. Abstract classes can have abstract methods, which are meant to be overridden by subclasses.

## Conclusion

Inheritance is a powerful mechanism in Java that allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. It promotes code reuse, modularity, and extensibility. By understanding and utilizing inheritance effectively, you can create well-organized and maintain
