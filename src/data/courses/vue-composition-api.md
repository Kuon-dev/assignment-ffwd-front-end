# Vue Composition API

The Vue Composition API is a new way of organizing and reusing logic in Vue.js applications. It introduces a set of functions and syntax that allow you to define component logic in a more modular and flexible manner. In this tutorial, we'll explore the basics of the Vue Composition API and how it can benefit your Vue projects.

## Installation

The Vue Composition API is available as a separate package called `@vue/composition-api`. To use it in your project, you need to install it alongside Vue. Here's an example of installing both Vue and the Composition API using npm:

```bash
npm install vue @vue/composition-api
```

## Using the Composition API

To use the Composition API in your Vue components, you need to import the necessary functions from the `@vue/composition-api` package. Here's an example of importing the `reactive` and `computed` functions:

```javascript
import { reactive, computed } from '@vue/composition-api';
```

Once you've imported the necessary functions, you can start using them in your component's setup function.

## The `setup` Function

The `setup` function is a special function in the Vue Composition API that allows you to define the component's logic. It runs before the component is created and receives props and context as arguments. Inside the `setup` function, you can use the Composition API functions to define reactive data, computed properties, and other component logic.

Here's an example of using the `setup` function with the Composition API:

```javascript
import { reactive, computed } from '@vue/composition-api';

export default {
  setup(props, context) {
    // Define reactive data
    const state = reactive({
      count: 0,
    });

    // Define a computed property
    const doubledCount = computed(() => state.count * 2);

    // Define methods
    function increment() {
      state.count++;
    }

    // Return the values you want to expose to the component template
    return {
      state,
      doubledCount,
      increment,
    };
  },
};
```

In this example, we define reactive data using the `reactive` function, create a computed property using the `computed` function, and define a method. We then return the values we want to expose to the component's template.

## Using Composition API Functions

The Vue Composition API provides several functions that you can use to define reactive data, computed properties, methods, and more. Here are some commonly used functions:

- `reactive`: Creates a reactive object that automatically tracks its dependencies.
- `computed`: Creates a computed property based on one or more reactive dependencies.
- `watch`: Watches a reactive dependency and performs a callback when its value changes.
- `ref`: Wraps a value in a reactive container.
- `toRefs`: Converts a reactive object into a collection of refs for individual properties.
- `onMounted`: Runs a callback when the component is mounted to the DOM.

These are just a few examples of the functions available in the Composition API. You can explore the full list of functions in the Vue Composition API documentation.

## Conclusion

The Vue Composition API is a powerful addition to Vue.js that allows you to write more modular and reusable component logic. By using the Composition API functions inside the `setup` function, you can define reactive data, computed properties, and other component logic in a more flexible and organized manner. Experiment with the Composition API in your Vue projects and discover how it can enhance your development experience.
