# Java Abstraction

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to create abstract classes and interfaces to define common behavior and properties that can be inherited by concrete classes. It enables you to focus on the essential characteristics of an object while hiding the implementation details. In this tutorial, we'll explore the concept of abstraction and how it can be implemented in Java.

## What is Abstraction?

Abstraction involves creating abstract classes and interfaces that define a blueprint for other classes to follow. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods, as well as fields. On the other hand, an interface is a collection of abstract methods that define a contract for classes implementing the interface.

Abstraction allows you to define common behavior, properties, and method signatures without specifying the implementation details. Concrete classes that inherit from abstract classes or implement interfaces are responsible for providing the implementation for the abstract methods, making them more specific and concrete.

## Why Use Abstraction?

The main benefits of abstraction in Java are:

- **Encapsulation**: Abstraction promotes encapsulation by hiding the internal details of a class or object and providing only the essential interface to interact with it. This improves code maintainability and reduces complexity.
- **Code Reusability**: By defining common behavior and properties in abstract classes or interfaces, you can reuse the code in multiple classes, avoiding code duplication.
- **Flexibility**: Abstraction allows you to define a common interface that can be implemented by different classes, providing flexibility and extensibility in your code design.
- **Polymorphism**: Abstraction is closely related to polymorphism. By programming to interfaces or abstract classes, you can achieve polymorphic behavior, treating objects of different concrete classes as instances of their common abstraction.

## Abstract Classes

In Java, an abstract class is declared using the `abstract` keyword. It can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods, as well as fields. Abstract methods are declared without an implementation, using the `abstract` keyword and without braces. Concrete classes that inherit from an abstract class must provide implementations for all abstract methods or be declared as abstract themselves.

Here's an example of an abstract class in Java:

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    protected String name;
    
    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public abstract void makeSound();
    
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Animal` class is an abstract class with a constructor and two methods: `makeSound()` (abstract) and `sleep()` (non-abstract). The `makeSound()` method is declared as abstract and does not have an implementation. Any concrete class that extends the `Animal` class must provide an implementation for the `makeSound()` method.

## Interfaces

An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods and constants. It defines a contract that classes must adhere to by implementing all the methods declared in the interface. Interfaces are declared using the `interface` keyword, and methods in interfaces are implicitly abstract and public.

Here's an example of an interface in Java:

```java
public interface Vehicle {
    void start();
    void stop();
}
```

In the above example, the `Vehicle` interface declares two abstract methods: `start()` and `stop()`. Any class that implements the `Vehicle` interface must provide an implementation for these methods.

## Using Abstraction

To use abstraction in your Java programs, you can create concrete classes that inherit from abstract classes or implement interfaces. These concrete classes provide implementations for the
