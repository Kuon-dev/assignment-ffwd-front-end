# HTML Responsive

Responsive web design is an approach to designing and building websites that provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. With the increasing use of mobile devices, it's essential to create websites that adapt and respond to different device capabilities. HTML provides several techniques to achieve responsive web design.

## Fluid Layouts

One fundamental technique for creating responsive websites is using fluid layouts. A fluid layout adjusts its width and height proportionally based on the available screen size. You can achieve this by using relative units like percentages for widths instead of fixed units like pixels.

For example, instead of setting a fixed width for a container element like this:

```html
<div style="width: 960px;">...</div>
