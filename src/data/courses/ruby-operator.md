# Ruby Operators

Operators in Ruby allow you to perform various operations on variables and values. They are an essential part of any programming language. Let's explore some commonly used operators in Ruby.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

`````````ruby
# Addition
sum = 10 + 5   # sum = 15

# Subtraction
difference = 10 - 5   # difference = 5

# Multiplication
product = 10 * 5   # product = 50

# Division
quotient = 10 / 5   # quotient = 2

# Modulus (Remainder)
remainder = 10 % 3   # remainder = 1

# Exponentiation
power = 2 ** 3   # power = 8
`````````

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values and return boolean results (true or false) based on the comparison.

`````````ruby
# Equal to
result = 10 == 5   # result = false

# Not equal to
result = 10 != 5   # result = true

# Greater than
result = 10 > 5   # result = true

# Less than
result = 10 < 5   # result = false

# Greater than or equal to
result = 10 >= 5   # result = true

# Less than or equal to
result = 10 <= 5   # result = false
`````````

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine or manipulate boolean values.

`````````ruby
# Logical AND
result = true && false   # result = false

# Logical OR
result = true || false   # result = true

# Logical NOT
result = !true   # result = false
`````````

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

`````````ruby
# Simple assignment
x = 10

# Addition assignment
x += 5   # equivalent to x = x + 5

# Subtraction assignment
x -= 3   # equivalent to x = x - 3

# Multiplication assignment
x *= 2   # equivalent to x = x * 2

# Division assignment
x /= 4   # equivalent to x = x / 4
`````````

## Conclusion

This tutorial introduced you to various operators in Ruby, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators. Understanding and utilizing these operators will empower you to perform complex calculations, make logical decisions, and manipulate data in your Ruby programs.

Take time to practice using these operators in different scenarios and explore additional operators and their specific use cases as you progress in your Ruby programming journey.
