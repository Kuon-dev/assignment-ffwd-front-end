## What is PHP?

PHP is a widely used server-side scripting language for web development. It stands for Hypertext Preprocessor and is embedded within HTML code.

- PHP is executed on the server before being sent to the client's web browser.
- It allows for dynamic content generation, database connectivity, and interaction with web forms.

PHP can be used for various tasks, including:

- Generating dynamic web pages
- Handling form data
- Accessing databases
- Manipulating files and directories
- Implementing authentication and security measures
- Creating and interacting with APIs

PHP syntax is similar to C-based programming languages, and it provides a wide range of built-in functions and extensions for additional functionality.

To run PHP code, you need a PHP-enabled web server.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, learning PHP can open up many possibilities for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

Happy coding with PHP!
