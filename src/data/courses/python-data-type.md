# Python Data Types

Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that variables can hold values of different types. Here are some commonly used data types in Python:

## Numeric Types

### Integer (`int`)

Integers represent whole numbers without any decimal places. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = -10

### Float (`float`)

Floats represent numbers with decimal places. For example:

```python
pi = 3.14
temperature = -2.5

## Boolean Type

The Boolean type (`bool`) represents either `True` or `False` values. It is commonly used in conditional statements and logical operations. For example:

```python
is_valid = True
has_permission = False

## String Type

Strings (`str`) are used to represent text data. They are enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). For example:

```python
name = 'John'
message = "Hello, World!"

## List Type

Lists (`list`) are ordered collections of items. They can hold values of different types and are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified. For example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

## Tuple Type

Tuples (`tuple`) are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation. They are defined using parentheses (). For example:

```python
point = (3, 5)
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')

## Dictionary Type

Dictionaries (`dict`) are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each value is associated with a unique key, allowing for fast retrieval of values. For example:

```python
person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

## Set Type

Sets (`set`) are unordered collections of unique elements. They do not allow duplicate values. For example:

```python
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}

## Conclusion

Understanding different data types in Python is crucial for writing effective programs. Python provides a rich set of built-in data types that you can use to store and manipulate data according to your needs. By familiarizing yourself with these data types, you'll be able to work with various kinds of data and perform different operations in your Python programs.
